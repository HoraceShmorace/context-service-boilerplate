# ContextService
The Context Service determines the context (topics) of webpages by matching text content against a dictionary of significant words and weighting those matches, allowing ads or content to be targeted according to context.

## Installation
* `git clone` the repo.
* `npm install`.
* Edit the environment settings in the `app/config/env` directory. Once you do, be sure to add `/app/config/env/*` to `.gitignore` if you plan to submit pull requests.

## Requirements
* Node.js
* MongoDB

## Running the Service
* At the command line, run `node server.js`.
* In the browser, go to `http://localhost:9090`. 

## TODO:
* Flesh out this README to include architectural, API, and database documentation.
* Add install script for required MongoDB database.
* Add JSDoc support.
* Add tests.
* Add GruntFile.
